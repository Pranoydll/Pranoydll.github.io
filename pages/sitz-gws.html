        Dear Mr. and Mrs. Sitzler,
      </p>
      <p id="indent">
        We haven't spend much time together as student and teacher,
        however, it was clear to me that you two are already some of the <b>best</b>
        teachers I have ever had and it is only the second week of school! Mrs. Sitlzer, you made Algebra, something
        I wasn't confident in, easy to understand and Mr. Sitzler, I thought your
        class was <b>amazing</b> because it was interesting to see how people were flawed in the past, against how people are flawed
        now. I think math and history are some of the most interesting subjects because most of the time it makes sense, and if it doesn't,
        I know that one of you will help me. Thank you for your time so far and I hope to see you again in class soon!
      </p>
